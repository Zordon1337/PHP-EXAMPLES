# HOW IT WORKS?

GET is method to send some data beetwen pages

for example if we have form like in this

and we want to make site say "Hello, your name" but to make that we must sent somehow your name to other page to
to make site know whats your name and now we use method called "GET"
there is two methods "GET" and "POST" but we will use GET in this example i prefer POST because it's more secure
anyways

so when we click "Next"
we will be redirected and our url will be something like this "http://example.org/GETexample.php?yourname=name"
but what "?yourname=" means. it's GET requests in that situation using GET method we trying to sent variable called "yourname" and value 
of this variable is "name"

# i hope i didin't made that much grammar mistakes while making this and i hope you will understand this at least
